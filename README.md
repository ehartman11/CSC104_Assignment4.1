This repo contains files to run an HTML webpage that acts as a central hub for information and navigation pertaining to Python related webpages.  
There is also an images folder that contains .png images for use in the PyNews HTML doc, for the links therein. 
The pyNews.py file is accessible for viewing as well, but I have yet to find a successful way to link it to the PyNews.HTML doc. 
It's purpose is to eventually serve as a way to dynamically write to the PyNews.HTML doc every time it is loaded, in order to update the relevant Python news links posted on news.Google.com.
pyNews.py does currently work to do this, but simply not upon loading the associated HTML doc. The script must be run separately to fill the list elements. As of right now, it also does not clear the old list present in PyNews.HTML. I am currently working on that function.
